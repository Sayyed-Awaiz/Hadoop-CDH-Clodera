# Hadoop-CDH-Clodera

About Use case:

Telefónica Spain is the leading telecommunications company in Spain, offering voice, data, television, and Internet access to consumers and businesses.
Telefónica Spain achieves a 20% increase in customer usage when it deploys a modern data platform from Cloudera


Challenges:

• To handle more than ten billion records a day, the cost was impractical with techniques other than a big data platform

• To gain more customer insight, the organization needed the ability to analyze a wider volume of data, and do so in real time.

• Virtually, all data is received in real time, or almost real time, and volumes are very high because we have almost 40 million connections


Solution:

• By utilising Cloudera, a leader in data warehousing, we were able to offer a robust and highly accessible ETL environment.


• Capacity Planning for Node Selection and Storage and Compute Layer Optimal utilization with Overhead.

• Production Grade Architecture, Including HDFS as the Storage Layer, YARN as the Resource Management layer, and Kafka as the Extration tool
